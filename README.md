## TokenMint Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract named TokenMint. The contract facilitates token minting, burning, and transfer functionalities. Below is an overview of the contract features:

### Contract Features:

1. **Token Minting:**
   - Only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
   - The owner can specify the recipient address and the amount of tokens to mint.

2. **Token Burning:**
   - Any token holder can burn their own tokens.
   - The contract verifies that the sender has sufficient balance before allowing token burning.

3. **Token Transfer:**
   - Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses.
   - The contract ensures that the sender is not the recipient and that the sender has enough tokens to transfer.

### Contract Details:

- **Token Name:** Token
- **Token Symbol:** T

### Repository Structure:

- **TokenMint.sol:** Contains the Solidity smart contract code.
- **README.md:** Provides instructions and information about the TokenMint contract.

### Usage:

1. **Deploy Contract:**
   - Deploy the TokenMint contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Ensure to specify the token name, symbol, and initial supply upon deployment.

2. **Interact with the Contract:**
   - Utilize the provided functions to mint, burn, and transfer tokens.
   - Only the contract owner can mint tokens, while any token holder can burn their own tokens and transfer them to other addresses.

### Development and Testing:

- This contract has been developed using Solidity version 0.8.19.
- It's recommended to test the contract extensively on test networks before deploying it to the mainnet.
- Use appropriate testing frameworks such as Truffle or Hardhat for testing.
